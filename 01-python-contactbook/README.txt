This code needs knowledge of SQL and how to use SQLite.

When the code starts, the user should see a menu with 3 options:
[1]See the contacts, [2]Register new contacts, [3]Manipulate existent contacts.

The first option give us a list with Name, Number and occasionnaly Email address. 
[EXTRA]The user should be able to select this contact to see more informations (Birthday, address, ...).
The second option shows a menu in which the user can enter the new contact coordonates and save it.
The third option allows the user to edit the name, number and occasionnaly email address of the select contact.

All of this options should have a "return to the menu" option.
